# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The analysis involves using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to analyse and visualise the 2019 ride-sharing data at PyBer- a Python based ridesharing company. The analysis will help the decision makers at PyBer to understand the following with regard to the various city types:
* Differnces in the percentage of total rides by city type.
* Differences in the percentage of total drivers by city type.
* Differences in the percentage of total fares by city type.
* The average fare per ride and driver by city type.
* The total fare by city type.

### Purpose of the analysis:
The analysis and visualizations will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


## Results 
### Differences in the percentage of total rides by city type:

![Figure 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111387025/192870221-26a68248-488f-4a3e-aab6-84b18b376247.png)
The figure clearly indicates that the maximum percentage of rides were taken in urban areas(68.4%), followed by suburban areas(26.3%) and the least in rural areas(5.3%).

### Differences in the percentage of total drivers by city type:

![figure 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111387025/192871074-1bb681a7-d747-4043-8023-c00d1c120710.png)
The pie-chart indicates a huge difference in the percentage of total drivers as the urban areas had 80.9% of the total drivers as compared to only 16.5% in suburban areas and the lowest 2.6% in rural areas.

### Differences in the percentage of total fares by city type:

![figure 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111387025/192871861-8efa62e9-b9fc-4db7-a6c8-7ad91b65201e.png)
The figure shows that despite the number of drivers were less in suburban areas as compared to the urban areas, but still it contributed substantially towards total fares i.e. 30.5%. However, the maximum contribution was from the urban areas i.e. 62.7%. Lastly, the rural areas contributed by 6.8% towards the total fares.

### The average fare per ride and driver by city type:

![avg fare](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111387025/192873400-83dc5cad-9e14-401d-839b-0bab25b748ba.png)
The bubble chart clearly explains that there exists a negative relationship between the average fare and the total number of rides per city type. Therefore, as the number of rides are increasing the average fare is decreasing.
The figure depicts using big bubbles that there are more drivers in the urban areas where the average fare is much lower as compared to other city types. However, the drivers are much less in number in rural areas as depicted by the small bubbles. Also, the average fare in rural areas is much higher. The suburban areas are somewhere in the intermediate zone, between the urban and the rural areas with regard to average fares and driver count.

### The total fare by city type:

The above line chart shows the data from January 2019 to April 2019. It is evitable from the chart that the weekly total fares were the highest in the urban areas followed by the suburban areas and the lowest in the rural areas.

## Summary
* From the analysis, it can be concluded that eventhough the number of drivers are less in suburban areas, this city type is contributing substantially towards the total fares of the company. Therefore, it is good to expect better revenues from this city type by enhancing the services in suburban areas.
* The rural areas city type is the most underserved neighbourhood. However, the number of rides and contribution to total fares is still higher than the percentage of total drivers. Therefore, efforts can be made to make the ride-sharing more economical in these areas, as the high average fare might be an obstacle in the way of increasing the total fares from this city type.
* By including the several other important factors in the analysis such as, occupation structure, population distribution, prefernces etc. will assist better in understanding the demand of the people from a particular city type. This will help in stating the underlying causes of disparities among these city types and hence, preparing a business model while keeping such factors in consideration might lead in increase in the total fares from even the most underserved neighbourhoods.
